conpaas-director
================

This application allows to start and stop ConPaaS service managers. The idea is
that once a manager is running, every subsequent operation can be done directly
through the manager.

Installation and running
------------------------
Ensure you have virtualenv installed 
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

On Debian/Ubuntu systems it can be installed by means of 
    apt-get install python-virtualenv

From within the directory where this README resides
    virtualenv --no-site-packages .
    source bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The above mentioned commands will create a isolated Python environment, with
all the required libraries installed.

Rename director.cfg.example to director.cfg and edit it.

conpaas-directory can then be started as follows:
    python app.py
