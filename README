conpaas-director
================

This application allows to start and stop ConPaaS service managers. The idea is
that once a manager is running, every subsequent operation can be done directly
through the manager.

Installation 
------------
Ensure you have virtualenv installed 
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

On Debian/Ubuntu systems it can be installed by means of 
    apt-get install python-virtualenv

From within the directory where this README resides
    virtualenv --no-site-packages .
    source bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The above mentioned commands will create a isolated Python environment, with
all the required libraries installed.

Rename director.cfg.example to director.cfg and edit it.

Also put a copy of ConPaaS.tar.gz here.

Usage
-----
Create a new user:
    python adduser.py email@example.org user pass

conpaas-director can then be started as follows:
    python app.py

New services can easily be started via curl:
    curl -d "username=user&password=pass" http://director.example.org:5000/start/php

And stopped:
    curl -d "username=user&password=pass" http://director.example.org:5000/stop/1
