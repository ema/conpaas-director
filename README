conpaas-director
================

This application allows to start and stop ConPaaS service managers. The idea is
that once a manager is running, every subsequent operation can be done directly
through the manager.

Installation 
------------
Ensure you have virtualenv installed 
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

On Debian/Ubuntu systems it can be installed by means of 
    apt-get install python-virtualenv

From within the directory where this README resides
    virtualenv --no-site-packages .
    source bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The above mentioned commands will create a isolated Python environment, with
all the required libraries installed.

Rename director.cfg.example to director.cfg and edit it.

Also put a copy of ConPaaS.tar.gz here containing the ConPaaS services code.

Deployment
----------
In a production environment you can use mod-wsgi to deploy conpaas-director:

    apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi

Apache needs to know where to find the director. An example of how to configure
Apache to serve conpaas-director follows. 

    <VirtualHost *>
        ServerName example.com

        WSGIDaemonProcess director user=user1 group=group1 threads=5
        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/conpaas-director/director.wsgi

        <Directory /var/www/conpaas-director>
            WSGIProcessGroup director
            WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
            Order deny,allow
            Allow from all
        </Directory>

        SSLEngine on

        SSLCertificateFile    /etc/conpaas/certs/cert.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/conpaas/certs/key.pem

        SSLCACertificateFile  /etc/conpaas/certs/ca_cert.pem
    </VirtualHost>

Usage
-----
Create a new user:
    python adduser.py email@example.org user pass

conpaas-director can then be started for testing purposes as follows:
    python app.py

New services can easily be started via curl:
    curl -d "username=user&password=pass" http://director.example.org:5000/start/php

And stopped:
    curl -d "username=user&password=pass" http://director.example.org:5000/stop/1
